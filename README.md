Hey I'm Ananth, a Linux Engineer and SRE.
If I own something with a CPU in it, chances are I've booted up Linux on it.

I'm a seasoned Go developer with experience working on the language and toolchain.
I've worked on OCI projects like [Podman](https://github.com/containers/podman) 
& skopeo, and ASDF Projects like OpenColorIO.
Currently learning [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) and exploring [Zig](https://ziglang.org).

I started blogging over at [devhuman.net](https://devhuman.net). Check it out!
