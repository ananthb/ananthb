Hey I'm Ananth, a Staff Engineer over at [Qube Wire](https://qubewire.com).
If I own something with a CPU in it, chances are I've booted up Linux on it.
I'm a seasoned Go developer with experience hacking on the language and toolchain.
I've worked on OCI projects like [Podman](https://github.com/containers/podman) 
& skopeo, and ASDF Projects like OpenColorIO.
Learning [Zig](https://ziglang.org) and [Rust](https://rust-lang.org).

I started blogging at [coredump.blog](https://coredump.blog).
Read my latest post about a project we shipped at work called [Bifrost](https://coredump.blog/posts/bifrost).
