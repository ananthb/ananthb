Hey I'm Ananth, Linux Engineer and SRE.
If I own something with a CPU in it, chances are I've booted up Linux on it.
My homeserver is an Apple Mac Mini M2 Pro running Asahi Linux and I'm loving
every minute of it.

I'm a seasoned Go developer with experience working on the language and toolchain.
I've worked on OCI projects like [Podman](https://github.com/containers/podman) 
& skopeo, and ASDF Projects like OpenColorIO.
Currently learning [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) and exploring [Zig](https://ziglang.org).

I started blogging over at [devhuman.net](https://devhuman.net). Check it out!
